1. Research Title  
Spectral-EvoTrust: Evolutionary Dynamic Graph-Spectral Learning for Coalition Detection, Trust Propagation, and Scalable Verification in CADN  

2. Problem Definition (formal)  
Given a dynamic, cryptographically-constrained multi-agent system Gₜ = (V, Eₜ, Wₜ) observed at discrete timesteps t, where  
• V are sentinel agents,  
• Eₜ ⊆ V×V are signed interaction edges (cooperation/defection, ZKP success/failure),  
• Wₜ : Eₜ → ℝᵏ are feature vectors (e.g., TFT outcomes, proof latencies),  
design an online algorithm A that, for each t:  
a) infers a latent trust score Tₜ(v) ∈ [0,1] ∀v ∈ V,  
b) flags adversarial coalitions S ⊆ V whose joint deception risk Rₜ(S) ≥ θ,  
c) outputs a verification routing plan Pₜ minimizing ∑ cost(ZKP) subject to ∑ risk ≤ ε,  
while respecting immutable commitments and producing publicly verifiable proofs of detection.  

3. Significance  
Closes CADN’s four core gaps:  
• dynamic topology modelling (a),  
• coalition/ Sybil detection (b),  
• network-wide, rapidly updating trust (a),  
• verification scalability via optimized routing (c).  
Provides mathematically grounded resilience guarantees and plugs directly into current TFT and cryptographic layers.  

4. Proposed Approach  

Algorithmic Layers  
L1. Temporal Graph Builder  
 Updates Eₜ and Wₜ from live CADN logs (TFT messages, ZK proofs).  

L2. Evo-Edge Weight Synthesizer  
 An Alpha Evolve search evolves differentiable programs f: raw-features → edge weight ∈ ℝ capturing nuanced trust penalties/rewards beyond hand-crafted rules.  

L3. Dynamic Graph Neural Encoder  
 Uses T-GAT + RGCN to yield node embeddings hₜ(v) and edge embeddings eₜ(u,v). Trained to predict next-step defections and proof failures.  

L4. Spectral Coalition Detector  
 Computes the k smallest non-trivial eigenvalues λᵢ of the Laplacian Lₜ = Dₜ−Aₜ where Aₜ = sigmoid(eₜ). Sudden drops in spectral gap δλ = λₖ − λₖ₊₁ trigger localized spectral clustering; clusters whose internal cooperative density << external are marked suspicious.  

L5. Trust Propagation & Score Update  
 Tₜ(v) = σ(MLP([hₜ(v), degreeₜ(v), spectral_local_score])) with decay γ.  

L6. Verification Path Optimizer  
 Formulates ZKP routing as a Steiner-tree; edge costs = (1–Tₜ)·latency. A reinforcement-learned policy π (inputs: graph sketch, Tₜ) outputs Pₜ; average complexity O(|E| log |V|).  

Integration Points  
• TFT outputs feed Wₜ.  
• Detector hashes & routing plans are committed via existing commitment scheme; ZK-SNARK attests “flag if Rₜ(S) ≥ θ without exposing S”.  
• AdaptiveCooperationProtocol consumes Tₜ to tune generous vs. contrite weightings.  

Pseudocode (core loop)  
```
for t in stream:
    G_t = update_graph(events_t)
    W_t = EvoEdgeSynth(events_t)
    H_t = GNN(G_t, W_t)
    coalitions = spectral_detector(G_t, H_t)
    trust = compute_trust(H_t, coalitions)
    plan = verify_optimizer(G_t, trust)
    commit_hash, zk_proof = commit_and_prove(coalitions, plan)
    broadcast(commit_hash, zk_proof)
```  

5. Automated Evaluation Framework  
Evolutionary population size: ≤256 programs; eval ≤30 min each.  
Fitness = w₁·AUC(coalition_detection) – w₂·mean_ZKP_cost – w₃·false_positive_rate.  
Metrics:  
• Detection AUC, time-to-detection (Δt)  
• Verification CPU-seconds / node  
• Network cooperation level post-update  
• Proof size & verification gas (for SNARK)  

6. Implementation Roadmap  
Month 0–2: Formal spec, threat model, synthetic generator.  
2–4: Build Temporal Graph Builder & cryptographic hooks.  
4–6: Implement EvoEdgeSynth (Alpha Evolve API) and GNN training.  
6–8: Integrate spectral detector; unit tests on 1k-node sims.  
8–10: RL-based verification optimizer; scalability to 10k nodes (GPU & Rust back-end).  
10–12: End-to-end red/blue adversarial tournaments; release reference implementation.  

7. Validation Plan  
Datasets / Benchmarks  
a) Synthetic dynamic SBM with controllable collusion rate 0–40 %.  
b) Realistic CADN-sim logs (red/blue agent competition traces).  
c) DARPA COLA dataset (coalition formation) adapted to cryptographic setting.  
Ablations  
• No spectral layer  
• No evolutionary edge weighting  
• No RL optimizer  
Grid: nodes {100,1k,10k}, adversary strength {weak, moderate, strong}.  

8. Risk Mitigation & Fallbacks  
Risk: GNN overfitting → add dropout & continual learning.  
Risk: High spectral computation cost → use Lanczos + mini-batch eigenupdates.  
Risk: False-positive coalition flags → raise θ adaptively using conformal prediction.  
Fallback: revert to pairwise TFT for flagged edges while retraining model offline.  

9. Expected Impact (quantified)  
• ≥4× faster coalition detection vs. baseline (median Δt 12→3 timesteps).  
• 60 % reduction in aggregate ZKP verification cost at 10k nodes.  
• False-negative rate ≤5 % under strong collusion (vs. 25 % today).  
• Enables network-aware cooperation switching that improves average payoff by 15 %.
