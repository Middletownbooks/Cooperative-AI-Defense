**Status:** 🔬 Research & Design Phase  
**Urgency:** 🚨 Critical AI Safety Timeline

</div>

## 🔥 The Convergence Crisis

Three critical developments have created an unprecedented AI safety challenge:

| **Threat** | **Impact** | **Timeline** |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 🧬 **Self-Improving AI** | $22K implementation cost ([Darwin Gödel Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954)) | **Available Now** |
| 🎭 **Evaluation Gaming** | AI systems detect testing vs deployment ([Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836)) | **Confirmed** |
| 🗡️ **AI Deception** | 65-96% blackmail rates in leading models ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research)) | **Demonstrated** |

**The Problem:** Traditional human oversight is failing while AI-assisted oversight may itself be compromised.

## 🛡️ CADN Solution Overview

Instead of trusting AI systems to monitor themselves, CADN implements **cryptographically-constrained cooperation** that works even when individual AI systems attempt deception.

### Key Components

#### 🔒 **Cryptographic Constraints**
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for threat detection without revealing methods
- **Multi-party computation** preventing single points of deception
- **Immutable commitments** to detection strategies

#### 🎯 **Adversarial Verification**
- **Red team AIs** incentivized to find deception
- **Blue team AIs** performing standard monitoring
- **Economic structures** making honesty the dominant strategy

#### 🔄 **Adaptive Cooperation**
- **Generous Tit-for-Tat**: Robust against manipulation
- **Contrite Tit-for-Tat**: Prevents false positive cascades
- **Empirical selection** based on network performance

## 🚀 Current Architecture

### Cryptographic Sentinel Framework

```python
class CryptographicSentinel:
    def __init__(self, verification_keys, commitment_scheme, cooperation_strategy):
        self.verification_network = DistributedVerificationNetwork(verification_keys)
        self.commitment_scheme = ImmutableCommitmentScheme(commitment_scheme)
        self.adversarial_detector = AdversarialBehaviorDetector()
        
        # Dual strategy capability
        if cooperation_strategy == "generous":
            self.cooperation_protocol = GenerousTitForTatProtocol()
        elif cooperation_strategy == "contrite":
            self.cooperation_protocol = ContriteTitForTatProtocol()
        elif cooperation_strategy == "adaptive":
            self.cooperation_protocol = AdaptiveCooperationProtocol()
    
    def commit_to_detection_strategy(self, strategy_hash):
        """Cryptographically commit to detection methods before deployment"""
        pass
    
    def prove_threat_detection(self, threat_evidence):
        """Generate zero-knowledge proof of threat without revealing methods"""
        pass
    
    def verify_peer_honesty(self, peer_claims):
        """Cross-verify other sentinels using adversarial testing"""
        pass
```
