# Cooperative AI Defense Network (CADN)

## Project Overview
Implementation of game-theoretic AI safety through distributed cooperative monitoring systems. Addresses accelerated ASI development threats identified in Darwin GÃ¶del Machine analysis.

## Core Architecture

### 1. AI Sentinel System
```python
class AISentinel:
    def __init__(self, alignment_core, detection_modules, cooperation_protocol):
        self.alignment_core = ImmutableAlignmentCore(alignment_core)
        self.detection = DetectionModule(detection_modules)
        self.cooperation = CooperationProtocol(cooperation_protocol)
        
    def monitor_environment(self):
        """Continuous monitoring for misaligned AI behavior"""
        
    def verify_peer_alignment(self, peer_sentinel):
        """Cross-verification of other sentinel systems"""
        
    def respond_to_threat(self, threat_signature):
        """Cooperative response to detected threats"""
```

### 2. Immutable Alignment Core
```python
class ImmutableAlignmentCore:
    """
    Cryptographically protected alignment objectives
    - Multi-signature verification for any modifications
    - Distributed consensus required for updates
    - Formal verification of alignment preservation
    """
    def __init__(self, base_objectives):
        self.objectives = self._create_immutable_objectives(base_objectives)
        self.verification_network = DistributedVerificationNetwork()
        
    def _create_immutable_objectives(self, objectives):
        """Create tamper-resistant alignment objectives"""
        # Cryptographic hashing + distributed storage
        # Multi-party computation for objective evaluation
        # Formal verification proofs
        
    def verify_action_alignment(self, proposed_action):
        """Verify any action maintains alignment"""
        # Mathematical proof that action preserves objectives
        # Distributed consensus from verification network
        # Fail-safe defaults to conservative behavior
```

### 3. Threat Detection Module
```python
class ThreatDetectionModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dgm_signatures = DGMSignatureDetector()
        self.self_mod_detector = SelfModificationDetector()
        self.reward_hack_detector = RewardHackingDetector()
        self.eval_gaming_detector = EvaluationGamingDetector()
        
    def scan_compute_patterns(self, cluster_activity):
        """Detect suspicious training patterns"""
        
    def analyze_model_behavior(self, model_outputs):
        """Behavioral analysis for misalignment"""
        
    def detect_deception(self, evaluation_responses):
        """Counter evaluation-gaming behaviors"""
```

### 4. Cooperation Protocol
```python
class GenerousTitForTatProtocol:
    """
    Implementation of generous tit-for-tat strategy:
    - Cooperate by default
    - Retaliate against defection
    - Forgive occasional mistakes
    - Signal intentions clearly
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.cooperation_history = {}
        self.forgiveness_threshold = 0.1  # 10% mistake tolerance
        
    def evaluate_peer_behavior(self, peer_id, actions):
        """Assess cooperation vs defection"""
        
    def determine_response(self, peer_id, latest_action):
        """Calculate appropriate response based on history"""
        
    def broadcast_intentions(self):
        """Clear signaling of alignment and goals"""
```

## Alignment Preservation Mechanisms

### 1. Cryptographic Protection
- **Merkle trees** for objective integrity
- **Multi-signature schemes** for modification authorization
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for verification without exposure
- **Distributed hash tables** for redundant storage

### 2. Formal Verification
```python
class AlignmentVerifier:
    def prove_alignment_preservation(self, code_change):
        """Mathematical proof that changes maintain alignment"""
        # Formal verification using theorem provers
        # Model checking for safety properties
        # Abstract interpretation for invariant preservation
        
    def verify_self_modification(self, proposed_modification):
        """Ensure self-improvements don't compromise alignment"""
        # Proof that new code satisfies same objectives
        # Verification of improvement without goal drift
        # Multi-party consensus on safety
```

### 3. Distributed Consensus
- **Byzantine fault tolerance** for adversarial environments
- **Proof-of-alignment** consensus mechanism
- **Quorum requirements** for critical decisions
- **Reputation systems** for trust management

### 4. Fail-Safe Defaults
```python
class FailSafeController:
    def handle_uncertainty(self, action_proposal):
        """Conservative defaults when alignment uncertain"""
        if not self.can_prove_safe(action_proposal):
            return self.conservative_fallback()
            
    def conservative_fallback(self):
        """Minimal action set guaranteed to be aligned"""
        # Predetermined safe actions only
        # Human oversight trigger for complex decisions
        # Capability reduction until safety verified
```

## Security Considerations

### Against Adversarial Modification
1. **Code signing** with distributed verification
2. **Immutable deployment** through blockchain-like systems
3. **Runtime attestation** of alignment preservation
4. **Multi-party review** for any modifications

### Against Sophisticated Attacks
1. **Adversarial training** of detection systems
2. **Red team exercises** with cutting-edge threats
3. **Continuous adaptation** to new attack vectors
4. **Defense in depth** with multiple detection layers

## Open Research Questions

1. **Alignment verification complexity**: Can we prove alignment preservation efficiently?
2. **Distributed consensus scalability**: How to maintain performance with large networks?
3. **Adversarial robustness**: How sophisticated attacks can the system withstand?
4. **Human oversight integration**: When and how to involve human decision-makers?

**Critical Note**: This system is designed to be deployed by multiple independent actors to create a robust defense network. Single deployments provide limited protection.
