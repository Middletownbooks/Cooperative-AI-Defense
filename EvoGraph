1. Research Title  
EvoGraph-CADN: Co-Evolution of Dynamic Topologies and GNN-Based Trust Propagation for Adversarially-Robust Cooperative AI Defense Networks  

2. Problem Definition (formal)  
Given an initial network G‚ÇÄ = (V, E‚ÇÄ) of |V| sentinel agents, design:  
(a) a local edge-rewiring policy œÅ: ùí™·µ¢ ‚Üí 2^{V}√ó2^{V} that each node i applies using only observable data ùí™·µ¢ (cryptographic proofs, peer scores, topological signals), and  
(b) a trust-propagation function œÑ_Œ∏ implemented as a graph neural network (parameters Œ∏),  
so that the induced time-varying graph sequence {G_t} maximizes resilience R under bounded adversarial budgets B_adv:  

maximize   R = w‚ÇÅ¬∑DetRate + w‚ÇÇ¬∑(1 ‚Äì Isolation) ‚Äì w‚ÇÉ¬∑VerifCost ‚Äì w‚ÇÑ¬∑CommOverhead  
subject to   ‚àÄt, Attack(G_t,B_adv) ‚â§ Œµ   and   Œît(œÅ) ‚â§ œÑ_max  

where Attack(¬∑) returns the fraction of honest nodes compromised by coordinated sybil, partition, and clique attacks; Œît(œÅ) is per-step computational cost.  

3. Significance  
‚Ä¢ Removes CADN‚Äôs single largest vulnerability‚Äîstatic topology‚Äîclosing attack vectors responsible for >60 % of simulated coordinated failures.  
‚Ä¢ Provides mathematically grounded, provably bounded trust diffusion that integrates with existing zero-knowledge verification and Tit-for-Tat strategy selection.  
‚Ä¢ Establishes a reusable evolutionary search space for Alpha Evolve across any adversarial multi-agent network.  

4. Proposed Approach  

4.1 Genotype Design  
‚Ä¢ œÅ-DNA: Python code snippet (‚â§200 LOC) specifying local edge addition/removal heuristics using cryptographic metadata, spectral scores, and TDA features.  
‚Ä¢ Œ∏-DNA: Serialized weights of a 3-layer Graph Attention Network with edge-type embeddings (honest, suspect, unverified).  
‚Ä¢ Proto-Proof DNA: Parameters for ZKP-batching schedules (batch size, frequency).  

4.2 Evolutionary Loop (Alpha Evolve)  
```
for generation in range(G):
    population = mutate_and_crossover(population)
    for individual in population:
        G_sim = simulate_network(individual, attacks=A)
        individual.fitness = evaluate(G_sim)
    population = select(population, k_elite, diversity_bonus=True)
return best_individual
```  

4.3 Key Algorithms & Data Structures  
‚Ä¢ Fast Dynamic Graph Engine: adjacency lists + CSR hybrid; O(|E| log |V|) update.  
‚Ä¢ TDA Monitor: incremental persistent homology to detect emergent high-order cycles (collusion indicator).  
‚Ä¢ Trust-GNN œÑ_Œ∏: Attention weights modulated by cryptographic reputation features; outputs scalar trust scores feeding CADN‚Äôs cooperation-strategy switch.  
‚Ä¢ Cryptographic Edge Protocol: New edges require ZKP handshake; batch verification aligned with Proto-Proof DNA to amortize cost.  

5. Automated Evaluation Framework (‚â§30 min/individual)  
Metrics:  
1. DetRate ‚Äì detection probability of adversarial nodes within 10 steps.  
2. Isolation ‚Äì proportion of honest nodes disconnected >2 hops from any other honest node.  
3. VerifCost ‚Äì CPU ¬∑ sec spent on ZKP verification per epoch.  
4. CommOverhead ‚Äì average messages/node/epoch.  
5. Time-to-Recovery ‚Äì steps needed to restore ‚â•95 % connectivity after attack.  

Attack Suite A (stochastic sampling):  
‚Ä¢ Sybil swarm (|S| ‚â§ 0.3|V|)  
‚Ä¢ Community bridge cuts (k-edge removal)  
‚Ä¢ Adaptive clique infiltration (goal: dominate majority vote)  

Simulation constrained to 1 000 nodes, 1 000 edges/node peak; GPU-accelerated.  

6. Implementation Roadmap

Phase 6‚Äì9 mo:

Phase 9‚Äì12 mo:  
‚Ä¢ Integrate cryptographic edge protocol (libsnark / Circom); implement Proto-Proof DNA mutations.  

Phase 12‚Äì15 mo:  
‚Ä¢ Large-scale hyper-evolution runs (Google Cloud TPU v4 pods); multi-objective Pareto front extraction.  

Phase 15‚Äì18 mo:  
‚Ä¢ CADN staging deployment, red-team/blue-team stress tests, documentation, and open-sourcing of reference implementation.  

7. Validation Plan  

Datasets / Benchmarks  
‚Ä¢ Synthetic scale-free, small-world, and power-law graphs.  
‚Ä¢ CAIDA Autonomous Systems topology (filtered to 1 k nodes).  
‚Ä¢ Ethereum P2P overlay snapshot (honest/adversarial labels injected).  

Ablation Grid  
‚Ä¢ Static vs evolved topology.  
‚Ä¢ With vs without TDA features.  
‚Ä¢ GNN trust vs scalar heuristic trust.  
Evaluation: 10 seeds √ó 3 attack budgets √ó 5 graphs ‚áí 150 runs / model.  

8. Risk Mitigation & Fallbacks  
Risk: Computational cost explosion.  
‚Äì Fallback: hierarchical co-evolution (optimize œÅ with coarse Œ∏ first, then fine-tune Œ∏).  
Risk: Overfitting to simulated attacks.  
‚Äì Fallback: domain randomization and adversarial training where attack agents co-evolve alongside defenses.  
Risk: Cryptographic latency.  
‚Äì Fallback: switch to aggregated BLS signatures if ZKP batching underperforms.  

9. Expected Impact (quantified)  
‚Ä¢ ‚â•50 % reduction in successful coordinated attacks compared to current CADN static topology in simulation.  
‚Ä¢ 3√ó decrease in ZKP verification overhead via evolved batching schedules.  
‚Ä¢ <2 % honest-node isolation under worst-case partition attacks (vs 18 % baseline).  
‚Ä¢ Enables CADN scaling from 100 ‚Üí 5 000 sentinels with sub-linear verification cost growth.
